# Regression

Overview: You are given a very simple dataframe with 3 variables w, x and y. You need to predict y, given w and x. 

## Steps

You should already know by now; how to use pandas, load a dataframe, write model/function, predict and visualize the outputs.

These are mandatory but extras are always be helpful for you (extras is extra preference and extra info)

## Data

[Kaggle Dataset Link](https://kaggle.com/datasets/222808b5f956447e66f9b533b8010a214b1088c304aa20a28adc66f83877a9d2)

## Submision
Do all your solution stuff at the start, write a short story of what you did in that notebook and keep it with you. Later you have to either make it public and give its link or you have to add someone as colaborator to that notebook.

Submission will be checked thoroughly for fraudulent activities. If you were found guilty then you will be executed.

You will be found guilty if I think you used AI.

## Story and Visualization of test results are mandatory

<sup><sub>small secret once you finish the task if you know the inner meaning of w and x then only you actually completed the task</sub></sup>
